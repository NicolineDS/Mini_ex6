My program: https://rawgit.com/NicolineDS/Mini_ex6/master/Mini_ex5/empty-example/index.html

My program consists of multiple balls, which are bouncing around inside the frames of the canvas. All of the balls are starting at random places and are changing colours in a random order. The rules for my program are: 

-The circles must start different places.
-The circles shall bounce back when they hit the sides of the canvas.
-The circles need to have a random colour.

The program consists of a for-loop, a conditional statement and a class. The for-loop controls how many balls there are on the screen, while the conditional statement controls the bounce of the balls when they hit the side of the canvas.  One of my classmates helped me create the conditional statement and the class so I could develop a better understanding of how the different lines of code work together.
I think the random colours of the circles and the different start location for the balls create a very pretty image, and it is very fascinating to see how the image generates it self.
